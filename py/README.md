**Instructions**

**Notes**
This version is a python only adaptation of the version of the CraigsList parser which was created to be run from R

Relative to the R based and original python/C++ implementations, this version:
* adds the fuzzy file matching algorithm that was implemented for the R version
* removes the requirement of checking file sizes
* does not require conda/miniconda to be installed

**How to run**
With input data placed in same folder,

python3 run.py
